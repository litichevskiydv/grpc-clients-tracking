Interceptors for the client and server to collect statistics about consumer calls through Prometheus

## This was migrated to https://github.com/litichevskiydv/grpc-bay
This repository has been moved to the unified "monorepo". You can find the source under [/packages/grpc-clients-tracking](https://github.com/litichevskiydv/grpc-bay/tree/master/packages/grpc-clients-tracking).

# Install

`npm i grpc-clients-tracking`

# Usage

```javascript
const { clientInterceptorsFactory, serverInterceptor } = require("grpc-clients-tracking");

/*...*/

const server = await new GrpcHostBuilder()
  /*...*/
  .addInterceptor(serverInterceptor)
  /*...*/
  .bind(grpcBind)
  .buildAsync();

/*...*/
const client = new ServerClient(grpcBind, grpc.credentials.createInsecure(), {
  interceptors: [clientInterceptorsFactory()],
});
```

## Metrics example

```
# HELP grpc_server_calls_total Total number of calls, made by various consumers.
# TYPE grpc_server_calls_total counter
grpc_server_calls_total{consumer_name="consumer-app",consumer_version="1.0.1",client_version="2.3.5",grpc_method="SayHello",grpc_service="v1.Greeter",grpc_type="unary"} 1
```
